MUST DOs
0. Setup a trello / codecks.io board

2. Setup a custom modal
  a. The bootstrap modals are too limiting and I forsee a lot of use of modals around the site.
  b. Can we remove bootstrap js?

3. Winning a game? Add tickets to users ticket count
  a. Also setup a test premium user who can win premium tickets


4. Setup a sound manager
  a. Clicks, card flips, modal opening / close, etc. Basically game sounds.
  b. 


5. Forgot Password


6. Save Settings for the user. These are localStorage settings and do not need to be synced to the user...or do they? If multiple users use one browser they could get mixed up. 
  a. Perhaps we could save a different settings object for each user? localStorage.set('settings-uuid', {settings})


OPTIONAL Improvements

1. Download bootstrap SCSS and only take the parts we need?
